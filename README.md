# 2k-Europe-FIRS3
A 2k by 2k Openttd Map of Europe with FIRS3 Support

Hello, This is my first Openttd Scenario so give me a little break. Of course any suggestions are nice.

I have constantly played on tons of heightmaps of europe, but having them have all the default openttd city names irked be the wrong way. So i finally decided to bite the bullet and design my own. Currently I am making it with FIRS3 support as that is what i normally play with. 

I have a lot of mods on, but will also be removing all of them except only the neccessary ones. Of course you can always edit the scenario yourself to add or remove newgrf's as you please. I intend that the start date should be early 1800's. As always you can change it. In the future I also want to modify the map to be vanilla too but that will be a lot later.

This is also meant for multiplayer games because of how large it is so have fun!
